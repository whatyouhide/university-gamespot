# Gamespot

A bare bones website for the Web Technologies class @ univaq.

The website is built with vanilla PHP, and uses MySQL as a DBMS.
It's served by Apache (`.htaccess` is a fundamental component of the website).

## Installation

This short installation guide will assume that the website will be installed on
an Ubuntu server machine. It should work (with minor tweaks if need be) on other
Linux distributions too.
